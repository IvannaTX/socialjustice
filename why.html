               The GAO(Government Accountably Office) reported that non-Hispanic Black women were more than 3 times more likely to pass away during childbirth than non-Hispanic white women. Some examples that factor into this issue can be access to good health care, lack of knowledge of pregnancy warning signs, or missing or delayed diagnoses.
