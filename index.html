    <p> There are rights to which we are entitled, simply by virtue of our humanity.
         Human rights exist independent of our culture, religion, race, nationality, or economic status. 
         Only by the free exercise of those rights can we enjoy a life of dignity.
          Among all the rights to which we are entitled,health care may be the most intersectional and crucial. 
          The very frailty of our human lives demands that we protect this right as a public good. 
          Universal health care is crucial to the ability of the most marginalized segments of any population to live lives of dignity.
           Without our health we—literally—do not live, let alone live with dignity.
