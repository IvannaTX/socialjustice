        <h3>Our Vision:</h3>
        <p>A healthcare system committed to the awareness and elimination of health disparities, the facilitation of health and equal access to quality health and health care resources regardless of race, ethnicity or socio-economic status.</p>
        
        <h3>Mission:</h3> 
        <p>To increase the capacity of underserved racial and ethnic communities across the U.S. to achieve health equity.</p>
        
        <h3>Our Purpose:</h3>
        <p>
        Racial/Ethnic Groups We Serve:
        African Americans/Black
        Asian Americans
        Pacific Islanders
        Hispanic/Latinos
        Native Americans
        Caribbean Islanders
        </p>
        Each organization utilizes community-driven and evidence and/or practice-based strategies to identify and address the social determinants of health disparities among racial/ethnic populations across the nation.
        
        Our Approach
        The NRC supports organizations in developing community-centered, racially and ethnically appropriate interventions that are practice/evidence based to advance a social model of environmental, programmatic, and infrastructural change at the local, state and national levels.
        
        Key principles of any intervention includes the following:
        
        Impacted communities are actively engaged and participate in all stages of decision making, research, evaluation, policy and program development
        Community interventions are culturally relevant and address the effects of racism and inequalities in the socio-economic status of each community
        All efforts are designed to support collaboration and equity in partnerships between traditional researchers, public health agencies and local communities
        Resources are invested in local community organizations to build and sustain community capacity and increase the evidence for community-based interventions through documentation and dissemination.
